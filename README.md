# JustEnoughIDs Integration
This mod exists to provide enhanced mod support to JustEnoughIDs outside
of their release cycle. The Dimensional Development team are welcome to
incorporate any parts of this mod into their own.

### Current support
This mod currently enhances compatibility between JEID and the following mods
 - AbyssalCraft
 - Bookshelf (Hunting Dimension)
 - Twilight Forest

It is my intention to add more in the future as issues are reported. I am currently
aware of issues with Extra Utilities 2 and EvilCraft - these will be addressed at
the earliest opportunity.
